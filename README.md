5 TAROT APPLICATION!!!!

This single web page application is a 5 card spread designed to provide insight using the old tarot tradition. I've created this to bring convenience to the tarot enthusiast and ease to the tarot beginner. The application uses the Tarot API made by ekelen to pull 5 random cards, assign them to a question, and then allow the user to “flip” those cards for the name and meaning. I chose ekelen’s API because I found it very detailed and expansive with a full 78 cards. I had a tough time trying to figure out why I wasn't able to iterate over the response as is to populate the card information but I could for some reason iterate over the response to push each card object into an array which is what I ended up doing.

To use the “5 Tarot Application” the user will need to enter a name and hit submit. This will populate the page with the five cards for this spread with a card back image that I created myself. Mousing over a card will reveal the question bound to it and the user will need to click on a card/question to have the page alert them with the name of the card that was pulled along with the meaning. For ease of understanding, all cards are pulled with the intent of being read upright.
